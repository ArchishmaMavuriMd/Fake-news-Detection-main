# Fake News Detection Project

This project demonstrates a **fake news detection pipeline** using a variety of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning frameworks**. Built with **Python**, it incorporates both traditional machine learning approaches as well as deep learning models using **BERT embeddings**.

---

## Features

### Data Handling & Preprocessing
- **`pandas`** and **`numpy`** for dataset management.
- Text cleaning utilizing Python's **`re`** module.
- **Tokenization**, **stopword removal**, and **lemmatization** using **`nltk`** and **`spaCy`**.

### Machine Learning Pipelines
- **Random Forest Classifier** and **XGBoost** for fake news classification.
- **BERT-based model** for generating embeddings and performing classification.

### Deployment
- **Flask** web app interface to predict fake news interactively via a simple HTML form.

### Model Evaluation
- Models are evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **confusion matrices**, and **classification reports**.

## Running the Project

### Training the Models

Run the following script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance:

```bash
python Main.py
```

### Running the Web App

Start the Flask app to interactively classify news text:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the Fake News Detector.

## Additional Information

- **Model Pipelines:** The project includes multiple model pipelines, including:
  - **Traditional machine learning** (TF-IDF with RandomForest).
  - **Gradient boosting** (TF-IDF with XGBoost).
  - **Deep learning** using **BERT embeddings**.

- **Web Interface:** A **Flask** web app that allows users to submit text and receive real-time predictions of whether the news is real or fake.

- **Experiments:** **Jupyter notebooks** are provided for experimenting with various preprocessing techniques and model architectures.
